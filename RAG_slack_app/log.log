2024-12-12 15:07:19,902 - INFO - AI massage: Preprocessing in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the steps taken to clean and prepare raw textual data before it is analyzed or processed further. This can include tasks such as tokenization, removing stop words, stemming or lemmatization, and normalizing text. The goal of preprocessing is to transform the raw text into a structured format that can be more easily understood and utilized by NLP algorithms.

Why Language is hard to model?징Lets look at the definition of LanguagelDefinition 1: Language is a means to communicate, it is a semiotic system. By that we simply mean that it is a set of signs. A sign is a pair consisting in [] a signifier and a signified.lDefinition 2: A sign consists in a phonological structure, a morphological structure, a syntactic structure and a semantic structure.
